# Moses [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/7t1alxxjoy9ujtwq?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ExodusSistemas/moses)
Tools Framework for Web Development using ASP.NET C#

This framework consist in a set of tools and patterns for building SaaS applications for web using designs from Exodus Sistemas. This framework aggregates libraries needed 
to run Exodus projects and are open for general purpose usage.

This is version 5.0 and it's package can be downloaded from Nuget using.

`dotnet add package Moses`

This is a stripped version of the framework since it's the first version using EF7. (Previous versions used Linq to Sql). So a lot of functionality will
steal be re-written in order to reconstruct state of the art patterns for web api usage.

The version will advance in suporting Owin and Authentication for JSON REST api protocols and security. We will use MVC patterns for routing and MS WebApi.
